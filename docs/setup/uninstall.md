# Uninstall Voyager

To uninstall Voyager operator, run the following command:

```console
$ curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/7.1.0/hack/deploy/voyager.sh \
    | bash -s -- --uninstall [--namespace=NAMESPACE]

+ kubectl delete deployment -l app=voyager -n kube-system
deployment "voyager-operator" deleted
+ kubectl delete service -l app=voyager -n kube-system
service "voyager-operator" deleted
+ kubectl delete serviceaccount -l app=voyager -n kube-system
No resources found
+ kubectl delete clusterrolebindings -l app=voyager -n kube-system
No resources found
+ kubectl delete clusterrole -l app=voyager -n kube-system
No resources found
```

The above command will leave the Voyager crd objects as-is. If you wish to **nuke** all Voyager crd objects, also pass the `--purge` flag. This will keep a copy of Voyager crd objects in your current directory.
