# LoadBalancer

In `LoadBalancer` type Ingress, HAProxy pods are exposed via a LoadBalancer type Kubernetes service named `voyager-${ingress-name}`. You can apply the `ingress.appscode.com/type: LoadBalancer` annotation on a Ingress object to enable this type of Ingress. This is also the default type for Ingress objects. So, this annotaion is not required to enable this type.

## How It Works

- First, deploy voyager operator.

```console
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/7.1.0/hack/deploy/voyager.sh \
    | bash -s -- --provider=gke
```

- Now, deploy test servers using [this script](/docs/examples/ingress/types/loadbalancer/deploy-servers.sh) script.

```console
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/7.1.0/docs/examples/ingress/types/loadbalancer/deploy-servers.sh | bash

deployment "nginx" created
service "web" exposed
deployment "echoserver" created
service "rest" exposed
```

- Now, create an Ingress object running

```console
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/appscode/voyager/7.1.0/docs/examples/ingress/types/loadbalancer/ing.yaml
```

Please note the annotaiton on ingress:

```yaml
  annotations:
    ingress.appscode.com/type: LoadBalancer
```

```console
$ kubectl get pods,svc
NAME                                       READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

## FAQ

**How do I ensure that IP assigned my Ingress does not change?**

You can allocate a static IP to a LoadBalancer Ingress managed by Voyager. Say for example, you are using GKE. When you create an Ingress object, Voyager will create a Kubernetes Service of type LoadBalancer. This service will will automatically get a regional IP. If you want to keep that IP, you can mark that IP as static in Google cloud console
and the apply the annotation to your Ingress.

```yaml
  annotations:
    ingress.appscode.com/type: LoadBalancer
 `  ingress.appscode.com/load-balancer-ip: 'a.b.c.d'`
```


**How do I use a Global Static IP (anycast IP) with an Ingress in GKE?**

You can't use Global Static IP with a LoabBalancer Ingress managed by GKE. Voyager creates a `LoadBalancer` Service to expose HAProxy pods. Under the hood, Kubernetes creates a `Network LoadBalancer` to expose that Kubernetes service. Network LoadBalancers can only use regional static IPs.

If you want to use Global static IP with Google Cloud, these pods need to be exposed via  a HTTP LoadBalancer. Voyager does not support this today. This is not a priority for us but if you want to contribute, we can talk more. To use HTTP LoadBalancers today, you can use the `gce` ingress controller: https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-gce . You may already know that HTTP LoadBalancer can only open port 80, 8080 and 443 and serve HTTP traffic. Please consult the official docs for more details: https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/


**How to use LoadBalancer type ingress in Openstack?**

If you need to create an internal LB in Openstack, you can do so using `ingress.appscode.com/annotations-service` annotation on the Ingress object.

```yaml
  annotations:
    ingress.appscode.com/type: LoadBalancer
    ingress.appscode.com/annotations-service: |
      {
        "service.beta.kubernetes.io/openstack-internal-load-balancer": "true"
      }
```


**How to use LoadBalancer type ingress in Minikube cluster?**

Minikube clusters do not support service type `LoadBalancer`. So, you can try the following work arounds:

- You can set the `Host` header is your http request to match the expected domain and port. This will ensure HAProxy matches the rules properly.

```console
$ curl -vv <minikube-ip>:<node-port> -H "Host: app.example.com"
```

- This work around is available thanks to [@david92rl](https://github.com/david92rl). You can use a service type ClusterIP with an ip fixed (like 10.0.0.150), then create a route to it from host machine.

**_Minikube on Mac with virtualbox/vmware providers_**

```console
sudo route -n delete ${K8S_NETWORK} > /dev/null 2>&1
sudo route -n add ${K8S_NETWORK} $(minikube ip)
interface=$(ifconfig 'bridge0' | grep member | awk '{print $2}' | xargs | awk '{print $1}')
sudo ifconfig bridge0 -hostfilter ${interface}
```

**_Minikube on Linux_**

```console
sudo ip route del ${K8S_NETWORK}
sudo ip route add ${K8S_NETWORK} via $(minikube ip)
```

*K8S_NETWORK* usually is `10.0.0.0/24` but it's worth to double check always.
