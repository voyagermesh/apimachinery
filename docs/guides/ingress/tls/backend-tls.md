# Backend TLS Support

Voyager can connect to a tls enabled backend server with or without ssl verification.

Available options:

- `ssl`: Creates a TLS/SSL socket when connecting to this server in order to cipher/decipher the traffic. If verify not set the following error may occurred:

> Verify is enabled by default but no CA file specified. If you're running on a LAN where you're certain to trust the server's certificate, please set an explicit 'verify none' statement on the 'server' line, or use 'ssl-server-verify none' in the global section to disable server-side verifications by default.

- `verify [none|required]`: Sets HAProxy‘s behavior regarding the certificated presented by the server:
  - `none`: Doesn’t verify the certificate of the server
  - `required (default value)`: TLS handshake is aborted if the validation of the certificate presented by the server returns an error.

- `verfyhost <hostname>`: Sets a <hostname> to look for in the Subject and SubjectAlternateNames fields provided in the certificate sent by the server. If <hostname> can’t be found, then the TLS handshake is aborted. This only applies when verify required is configured.

Example: `ingress.appscode.com/backend-tls: "ssl verify none"`

If this annotation is not set HAProxy will connect to backend as http. This value should not be set if the backend do not support https resolution.

Example:

```yaml
kind: Service
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: my-service
  annotations:
      ingress.appscode.com/backend-tls: ssl verify none
spec:
  selector:
    app: MyApp
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 9376
```

```yaml
apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  backend:
    serviceName: test-service
    servicePort: '80'
  rules:
  - host: appscode.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          serviceName: my-service
          servicePort: '80'
```
