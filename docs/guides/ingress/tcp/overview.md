# TCP LoadBalancing

TCP load balancing is one of the core features of Voyager Ingress. Voyager can handle TCP Load balancing with or without TLS. One Voyager Ingress can also be used to load balance both HTTP and TCP.

One Simple TCP Rule Would be:

```yaml
apiVersion: voyager.appscode.com/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: test-ingress
  namespace: default
spec:
  tls:
  - secretName: mycert
    hosts:
    - other.example.com
  rules:
  - host: one.example.com
    tcp:
      port: '9898'
      backend:
        serviceName: tcp-service
        servicePort: '50077'
  - host: other.example.com
    tcp:
      port: '7878'
      backend:
        serviceName: tcp-service
        servicePort: '50077'
  - host: other.example.com
    tcp:
      port: '7800'
      noTLS: true
      backend:
        serviceName: tcp-service
        servicePort: '50077'
```

For this Ingress, HAProxy will open up 3 separate ports:
- port 9898: Passes traffic to pods behind tcp-service:50077. Uses no TLS, since `spec.TLS` does not have a matching host.

- port 7878: Passes traffic to pods behind tcp-service:50077. Uses TLS, since `spec.TLS` has a matching host.

- port 7880: Passes traffic to pods behind tcp-service:50077. __Uses no TLS__, even though `spec.TLS` has a matching host. This is because `tcp.noTLS` is set to true for this rule.

### Restrictions
 - For one Ingress, you cannot have multiple `tcp` rules listening to same port, even if they do not have same `host`.
