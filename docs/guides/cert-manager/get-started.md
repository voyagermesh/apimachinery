## 1. Install Cert-Manager

https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/getting-started/install/kubernetes.html

```console
kubectl create namespace cert-manager
kubectl label namespace cert-manager certmanager.k8s.io/disable-validation=true
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.8.1/cert-manager.yaml
```

Add `--validate=false` to the last command if your kubectl version is <= v1.12, like this:

```console
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/releases/download/v0.8.1/cert-manager.yaml --validate=false
```

## 2. Setup Issuer/ClusterIssuer

### [Supported Issuer](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/index.html)

These are the supported Certificate Issuers:

1. [acme](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-acme/index.html)
2. [ca](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-ca.html)
3. [self signed](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-selfsigned.html)
4. [vault](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-vault.html)
5. [venafi](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-venafi.html)

Here we will show issuing certificates from Let's Encrypt using ACME protocol. For others, click on the link for the respective issuers.

#### [acme](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/tasks/issuers/setup-acme/index.html)

The ACME Issuer type represents a single Account registered with the ACME server. When you create a new ACME Issuer, cert-manager will generate a private key which is used to identify you with the ACME server. To set up a basic ACME issuer, you should create a new Issuer or ClusterIssuer resource.

### [Issuer](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/reference/issuers.html)

Issuers (and ClusterIssuers) represent a certificate authority from which signed x509 certificates can be obtained, 
such as Letâ€™s Encrypt. You will need at least one Issuer or ClusterIssuer in order to begin issuing certificates within your cluster.

Like this [issuer.yaml](/docs/examples/cert-manager/issuer.yaml)

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  namespace: edge-services
spec:
  acme:
    # The ACME server URL
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # Email address used for ACME registration
    email: user@example.com
    # Name of a secret used to store the ACME account private key
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    # Enable HTTP01 validations
    http01: {}
```

The `spec.email` will be used to register for your let's encrypt account and `privateKeySecretRef` will contain the private key of this account.

#### [ClusterIssuer](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/reference/clusterissuers.html)

An Issuer is a namespaced resource, and it is not possible to issue certificates from an Issuer in a different 
namespace. If you want to create a single issuer than can be consumed in multiple namespaces, you should consider 
creating a ClusterIssuer resource.

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterIssuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
spec:
```

When referencing a Secret resource in ClusterIssuer resources (eg `spec.acme.solvers.dns01.cloudflare.apiKeySecretRef`) the Secret needs to be in the same namespace as the cert-manager controller pod. You can optionally override this by using the `--cluster-resource-namespace` argument to the controller.

### Let's Encrypt Production vs Staging Environment

For production use, use the Let's Encrypt Production API like above. For testing things out, you can use the Staging API as there is a rate limit for issuing certificates. Just replace the `spec.acme.server` like this

```yaml
spec:
  acme:
    server: https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
```

In this doc, we used the staging api and as a result, you will see that the certificate was issued by `Fake LE Intermediate X1`.

### [Certificate Duration and Renewal Window](https://docs.cert-manager.io/en/latest/reference/certificates.html)

The default duration for all certificates is 90 days and the default renewal windows is 30 days. This means that certificates are considered valid for 3 months and renewal will be attempted within 1 month of expiration.

You can change that value using `duration` and `renewBefore` field in [certificate.yaml](/docs/examples/cert-manager/certificate.yaml),

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  secretName: example-tls
  duration: 24h
  renewBefore: 12h
  dnsNames:
    - foo.example.com
    - bar.example.com
  issuerRef:
    name: my-internal-ca
    kind: Issuer
```

That means, this certificate's validity period is 24 hours and it will begin trying to renew 12 hours before the certificate expiration.
