# voyager
Voyager provides controller for [Ingress](#ingress) and [Certificates](#certificate) for Kubernetes developed by [AppsCode](https://appscode.com).


### Ingress
In here we call it ExtendedIngress.
An extended plugin of Kubernetes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/) by AppsCode, to support both L7 and L4 loadbalancing via a single ingress.
This is built on top of the HAProxy, to support high availability, sticky sessions, name and path-based virtual hosting.
This also support configurable application ports with all the features available in Kubernetes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/ingress/).

**Feautures**

  - [HTTP](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/single-service.md) and [TCP](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/tcp.md) loadbalancing,
  - [TLS Termination](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/tls.md),
  - Multi-cloud supports,
  - [Name and Path based virtual hosting](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/named-virtual-hosting.md),
  - [Cross namespace routing support](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/named-virtual-hosting.md),
  - [URL and Request Header Re-writing](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/header-rewrite.md),
  - [Wildcard Name based virtual hosting](docs/user-guide/component/ingress/named-virtual-hosting.md),
  - Persistent sessions, Loadbalancer stats.

### Certificate
Kubernetes Controller to manage TLS Certificate.

**Feautures**
- Manage Kubernetes TLS secrets backed by Custom Certificate Provider, Users Let's Encrypt by default,
- Manage issued certificates based on Kubernetes ThirdParty Resources,
- Domain validation using ACME dns-01 challenges,
- Support for multiple DNS providers,
- Auto Renew Certificates,
- Use issued Certificates with Ingress to Secure Communications.


## Supported Versions
Kubernetes 1.3+


## User Guide
To deploy voyager in Kubernetes follow this [guide](docs/user-guide/README.md). In short this contains those two steps

1. Create `ingress.appscode.com` and `certificate.appscode.com` Third Party Resource
2. Deploy voyager to kubernetes.

## Running voyager alongside with other ingress controller
voyager can be configured to handle default kubernetes ingress or only ingress.appscode.com. voyager can also be run
along side with other controllers.

```sh
  --ingress-class
  // this flag can be set to 'voyager' to handle only ingress
  // with annotation kubernetes.io/ingress.class=voyager.

  // If unset, voyager will also handle ingress without ingress-class annotation.
```
