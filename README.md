# Voyager
Voyager is a [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) backed [secure](#certificate) L7 and L4 [ingress](#ingress) controller for Kubernetes developed by
[AppsCode](https://appscode.com). This can be used with any Kubernetes cloud providers including aws, gce, gke, azure, acs. This can also be used with bare metal Kubernetes clusters.

## Ingress
Voyager provides L7 and L4 loadbalancing using a custom Kubernetes [Ingress](https://appscode.com/products/voyager/7.1.0/guides/ingress/) resource. This is built on top of the [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) to support high availability, sticky sessions, name and path-based virtual hosting.
This also support configurable application ports with all the options available in a standard Kubernetes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## Certificate
Voyager can automatically provision and refresh SSL certificates (including wildcard certificates) issued from Let's Encrypt using a custom Kubernetes [Certificate](https://appscode.com/products/voyager/7.1.0/guides/certificate/) resource.

## Supported Versions
Please pick a version of Voyager that matches your Kubernetes installation.
